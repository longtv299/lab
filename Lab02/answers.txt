Question:
- If you create a constructor method to build a DVD by title then
create a constructor method to build a DVD by category. 
Does JAVA allow you to do this?

Answer:

We can follow that instruction because JAVA allow us to create multiple constructors. A JAVA class can have many constructors but it have to
satisfy the constraint:the parameters they take mustn't coincide.
